## Errors?

- Identical courses can carry different names, ex, "Calculus I" and "Calculus 1". If you have replaced a course on your transcript, and that course has been renamed by the institution, the original attempt may incorrectly remain in your GPA calculation. 

Please report any instances of this to the developer, so the app can be updated.
